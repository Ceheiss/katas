# Todos, Ideas, etc.
- [ ] Deploy `<kataname>.spec.js` files too (the passing tests).
- [ ] Verify that all katafied tests fail (the katafication does really create failing tests).
- [ ] Remove lines which only have `////` and nothing beyond (I have not seen a case where I would not remove that line).
- [ ] Fix vulnerabilities that GH shows.
- [ ] Test if katafication results in invalid JS code (as happened for multiline kata)
- [ ] Test if every test has the katafy part in it
