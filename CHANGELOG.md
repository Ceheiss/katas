- [ ] Deploy `<kataname>-solve.js` files too.
- [ ] Add release script which also handles the changelog.
- [ ] Verify that all katafied tests fail (the katafication does really create failing tests).
- [ ] Remove lines which only have `////` and nothing beyond (I have not seen a case where I would not remove that line).

# v2

- [ ] Katafy all ES6 katas
