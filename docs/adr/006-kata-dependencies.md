# 0. Kata Dependencies

## Status

Drafting

## Context

Knowledge to solve a certain kata depends on the knowledge one should have gathered from other katas.
Within one kata-bundle (e.g. "es6/language") this is well defined and can be done already.
How can this be done across all katas in this repo?
E.g. a ES10 kata might require knowledge of something learned in an ES6 kata. To be able to inform the
user about such a learning path the katas should be able to reflect their dependencies throughout the
entire repo.
